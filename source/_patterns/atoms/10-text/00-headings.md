title: Headings
---
The basic rule is simple: the first HTML heading element (one of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>) defines the heading of the current section. The heading elements have a rank given by the number in the element name, where <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> has the highest rank, and <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> has the lowest rank. In practice, this ranking should reflect the outline of the document's sections.
